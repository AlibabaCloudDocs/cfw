# \[Virtual patch\] WebLogic wls9-async deserialization remote command execution

On April 17, 2019, Yundun emergency response center of Alibaba Cloud detected the vulnerability named as "Oracle WebLogic wls9-async deserialization remote command execution vulnerability" disclosed by China National Vulnerability Database \(CNVD\).
