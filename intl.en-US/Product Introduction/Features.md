# Features {#concept_xn2_hlj_bfb .concept}

Cloud Firewall supports centralized management of north-south and east-west traffic, and provides features including real-time traffic monitoring, precise access control, real-time intrusion prevention, and traffic logs to comprehensively protect your network.

Cloud Firewall supports the following features:

-   **Real-time traffic monitoring**:
    -   Monitors the external connection activities.
    -   Analyzes the access traffic from the Internet to your ECS instances.
    -   Analyzes the access traffic between ECS instances in your intranet.
    -   Gives you full visibility of your assets and access relationships between assets, helping you detect abnormal traffic in a timely manner.
-   **Precise access control**:
    -   Controls the access traffic from the Internet to your ECS instances \(north-south traffic\).
    -   Provides micro-isolation protection over the access traffic between ECS instances \(east-west traffic\) on your intranet.
    -   Controls inbound and outbound traffic.
    -   Performs domain name-based access control to strictly control the external connection traffic.
    -   Analyzes external connections activities to help you detect abnormal activities on ECS instances.
-   **Real-time intrusion prevention**:
    -   Intelligently detects and blocks intrusions in real time. Analyzes the network access traffic blocked by Cloud Firewall and IPS.
    -   Synchronizes malicious IP addresses \(for example, those of malicious visitors, scanners, and command-and-control servers\) detected on the entire Alibaba Cloud network to Cloud Firewall to defend against threats and intrusions in advance.
    -   Embedded with intrusion prevention rules concluded in long-term attack and defense practices on cloud platforms, featuring a high threat recognition rate and a low false alarm rate.
    -   Supports recovery through virtual patches instead of patch installation in business systems, and precisely protects against popular vulnerabilities and high-risk 0-day and N-day exploitation.
-   **Behavior backtracking**:
    -   Provides event logs to show real-time threats or intrusions detected and blocked by IPS.
    -   Provides traffic logs to show all the traffic that passes through Cloud Firewall. When a threat event occurs, you can view traffic logs to analyze the traffic, identify the visitors, and check whether the configured access control policies have taken effect.
    -   Provides system operation logs to show all the configuration and operation records in Cloud Firewall.
    -   Stores logs for a maximum of six months, which complies with network security regulations and classified protection requirements.
