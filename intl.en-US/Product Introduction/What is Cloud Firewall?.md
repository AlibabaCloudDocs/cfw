# What is Cloud Firewall?

Cloud Firewall is the first Firewall as a Service \(FWaaS\) solution that is provided by Alibaba Cloud for public clouds. Cloud Firewall allows you to centrally manage the access control policies that are used to control north-south traffic from the Internet to your ECS instances and the micro-segmentation policies that are used to control east-west traffic between ECS instances. Cloud Firewall provides a built-in Intrusion Prevention System \(IPS\) that allows you to view network-wide traffic and access relationships between businesses. Cloud Firewall is the primary infrastructure used to ensure the security of the businesses that you have migrated onto Alibaba Cloud.

Cloud Firewall complies with the following standards: ISO 9001, ISO 20000, ISO 22301, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, ISO 29151, ISO 27701, BS 10012, CSA STAR, and PCI DSS.
