# VPC access activities {#task_1925821 .task}

The **VPC Access** page in the Cloud Firewall console provides real-time traffic data between VPC networks. This helps you detect suspicious traffic and mitigate attacks in a timely manner. The **VPC Access** page displays the ranking of IP addresses by traffic between VPC networks, the ranking of sessions between VPC networks by traffic, the ports, and the assets in the specified VPC network.

Cloud Firewall provides VPC firewalls to detect suspicious network traffic between VPC networks. The VPC Access page displays all the traffic information detected by VPC firewalls.
