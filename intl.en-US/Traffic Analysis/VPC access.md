# VPC access

The **VPC Access** page provides real-time information about traffic between VPCs. It helps you promptly detect suspicious traffic and mitigate risks. You can view the statistics of traffic, sessions, ports, and assets involved in communications between VPCs.

Cloud Firewall provides VPC firewalls to detect suspicious traffic between VPCs. All traffic information is displayed on the VPC Access page.

**Note:** The VPC Access page displays traffic analysis data only after you enable the VPC Firewall feature. For information about how to enable the VPC Firewall feature, see [Activate Cloud Firewall](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Activate Cloud Firewall.md).
