# Enable or disable the Cloud Firewall service {#concept_hjf_vk4_cfb .concept}

Cloud Firewall is an out-of-the-box service that requires no complex configuration. It can control both inbound and outbound access and minimize vulnerabilities in your business that are exposed to attacks.

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Firewall console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=cfwnext#/overview).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Firewall Switch**.
3.  On the **Firewall Switch** page, enable or disable the Cloud Firewall service for all assets, or select one or more assets to enable or disable the Cloud Firewall service.******** 
    -   To enable or disable the Cloud Firewall service for all assets, click **Protect All** or **Protect None**.

        **Note:** By default, the Cloud Firewall service is disabled for all assets after you subscribe to the Cloud Firewall service. We recommend that you enable the Cloud Firewall service for all assets.

    -   To enable or disable the Cloud Firewall service for one or more assets, select the assets and click **Enable Protection** or **Disable Protection** in the **Action** column.

        **Note:** Once you click Protect All, the Cloud Firewall service first turns to the **Protecting** status for all assets. Wait for several seconds until the configuration takes effect.
