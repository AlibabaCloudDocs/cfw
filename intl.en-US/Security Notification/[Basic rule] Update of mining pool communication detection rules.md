Alibaba Cloud's Cloud Firewall has updated the mining pool communication detection rules.

With the rise of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, security events for the sake of profits by cryptocurrency mining are increasingly rampant. More and more servers are attacked for cryptocurrency mining. Once a computer is infected with a mining Trojan, it becomes a profitable tool for hackers, and the computer resources become exhausted. This brings serious impact on normal business. Recently, Cloud Firewall updated the mining pool communication detection rules. After the update, Cloud Firewall is able to detect the servers that hackers are using to mine cryptocurrency.
