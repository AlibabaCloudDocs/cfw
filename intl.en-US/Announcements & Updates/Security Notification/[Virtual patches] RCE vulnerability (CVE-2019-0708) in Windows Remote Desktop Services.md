# \[Virtual patches\] RCE vulnerability \(CVE-2019-0708\) in Windows Remote Desktop Services

On May 15, 2019, Microsoft released security patches to fix a remote code execution \(RCE\) vulnerability \(CVE-2019-0708\) in Windows Remote Desktop Services. This vulnerability has negatively affected some earlier Windows versions.

The vulnerability is caused by pre-authentication without user interaction. Unauthenticated attackers use RDP ports such as port 3389 to connect to a target server and send specially crafted requests. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the target server or spread computer worms to infect other servers in the internal network. This RCE vulnerability is similar to the vulnerabilities that are exploited to launch ransomware attacks, such as WannaCry in 2017.

Scope of impact:

-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2008 R2
-   Windows Server 2008
-   Windows Server 2003
-   Windows XP

Risk level: high

Rule-based defense: A virtual patch is available in the Cloud Firewall console to defend against this vulnerability.

Rule type: command execution

Security suggestions:

-   If you use Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2, install the [Windows security patch](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0708) at the earliest opportunity.
-   If you use Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP, update the system or install the [Windows security patch](https://support.microsoft.com/zh-cn/help/4500705/customer-guidance-for-cve-2019-0708) at the earliest opportunity.
-   Enable the Intrusion Prevention feature of Cloud Firewall.
-   Create an access control policy in Cloud Firewall to allow only the following remote connections:

    -   RDP connections from trusted sources
    -   RDP connections from the areas that are commonly used for remote access in your business
    After the policy takes effect, Cloud Firewall denies connection requests from other sources and areas that are not specified in the policy.
