# Use central account management

Cloud Firewall provides the feature of central account management. This feature allows you to use a single Alibaba Cloud account to manage multiple cloud accounts and resource accounts of an enterprise. This feature automatically adds the assets that belong to the cloud accounts or resource accounts to the current account.

## Prerequisites

-   Cloud Firewall Ultimate Edition is purchased. Other editions of Cloud Firewall do not support central account management.
-   The current account is specified as the delegated administrator account of Cloud Firewall. For more information, see [Add or remove a delegated administrator account]().
-   Cloud Firewall is authorized to access the resources of the member account that you want to add. To authorize Cloud Firewall, the administrator of the member account must complete the following operations: Log on to the Cloud Firewall console by using the member account. Visit the [Cloud Resource Access Authorization](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/role/authorization?request=%7B%22Services%22%3A%5B%7B%22Service%22%3A%22CloudFirewall%22%2C%22Roles%22%3A%5B%7B%22RoleName%22%3A%22AliyunCloudFirewallAccessingECSRole%22%2C%22TemplateId%22%3A%22ECSRole%22%7D%2C%7B%22RoleName%22%3A%22AliyunCloudFirewallDefautlRole%22%2C%22TemplateId%22%3A%22DefaultRole%22%7D%5D%7D%5D%2C%22ReturnUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fyundun.console.aliyun.com%2F%3Fp%3Dcfw%23%2Fcfw%2FresourceGraph%22%7D) page and click **Confirm Authorization Policy**.

    **Note:** For more information about authorization, see [Authorize Cloud Firewall](/intl.en-US/Overview/Authorize Cloud Firewall.md).


## Limits

-   Central account management allows you to add only one member account.
-   Central account management allows you to manage only the Internet firewalls that belong to multiple accounts.

## Add multiple Alibaba Cloud accounts
