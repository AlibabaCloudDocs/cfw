# Vulnerability prevention

The Vulnerability Prevention page displays information about the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by network attacks. The vulnerabilities are automatically detected by Security Center and synchronized to Cloud Firewall. On this page, you can also enable the firewalls of Cloud Firewall and configure the protection rules of the intrusion prevention system \(IPS\) to prevent the vulnerabilities from being exploited. This way, your assets are protected.

Threat Engine Mode on the **Prevention Configuration** page is set to **Medium**, which is below Block Mode.

**Note:** If Threat Engine Mode is not set to a value below Block Mode, the protection status of all vulnerabilities on the **Vulnerability Prevention** page is **Alert Only**. In this situation, Cloud Firewall generates alerts on and records detected vulnerabilities, but does not block attacks that exploit the vulnerabilities. For more information about Threat Engine Mode, see [Intrusion prevention mode](/intl.en-US/Intrusion prevention/Intrusion prevention.md).

## Limits

-   The Enterprise Edition and Ultimate Edition of Cloud Firewall support the vulnerability prevention feature. The free trial edition and Premium Edition do not support this feature.
-   Vulnerability scans on the Vulnerability Prevention page are automatically started. You cannot manually start the scans.

    **Note:** You can click **Update Prevention Status** to synchronize the latest vulnerability scan results from Security Center to Cloud Firewall. If you want to manually start a vulnerability scan, go to the Vulnerabilities page in the [Security Center console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=sas). For more information, see [t1881544.dita\#task\_2461190](/intl.en-US/Precautions/Vulnerabilities/Use the quick scan feature.md).


## Supported types of vulnerabilities for detection

-   **Web-CMS vulnerabilities**: website builder vulnerabilities that are detected by comparing vulnerability files with the vulnerability library. Common website builders are identified by monitoring website directories. For more information, see [View and handle Web-CMS vulnerabilities](/intl.en-US/Precautions/Vulnerabilities/View and handle Web-CMS vulnerabilities.md).
-   **Application vulnerabilities**: weak passwords of system services and vulnerabilities of system and application services. This type of vulnerability can be fixed by the vulnerability prevention feature. For more information, see [View and handle application vulnerabilities](/intl.en-US/Precautions/Vulnerabilities/View and handle application vulnerabilities.md).
-   **Urgent vulnerabilities**: urgent vulnerabilities that are detected on the Internet recently. This type of vulnerability can be fixed by the vulnerability prevention feature. For more information, see [View and handle urgent vulnerabilities](/intl.en-US/Precautions/Vulnerabilities/View and handle urgent vulnerabilities.md).

## Supported protection states of vulnerabilities

-   **Blocked**: The attacks that exploit the vulnerability are blocked by Cloud Firewall.
-   **Alert Only**: The vulnerability is detected by Cloud Firewall, which also generates alerts on the vulnerability. However, Cloud Firewall does not block the attacks that exploit the vulnerability.
-   **Partially Prevented**: The vulnerability prevention feature is enabled on some of your Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances.

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Firewall console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=cfwnext).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Intrusion Prevention** \> **Vulnerability Prevention**.

3.  On the Vulnerability Prevention page, view the results of vulnerability scans performed by Cloud Firewall on your assets.

    The Vulnerability Prevention page displays the results of vulnerability scans from the last one hour, one day, or seven days.

    -   Move the pointer over the ![More icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7550631061/p146900.png) icon in the **Vulnerable Asset** column. Then, you can view the IP addresses of servers that are exposed to the vulnerability.
    -   **Attack**: the total number of attacks that exploit the vulnerability on your assets.
    -   **Protection Status**: the method that Cloud Firewall uses to handle the vulnerability and attacks that exploit the vulnerability. The following states are supported:
        -   **Blocked**: The attacks that exploit the vulnerability are blocked by Cloud Firewall.
        -   **Alert Only**: The vulnerability is detected by Cloud Firewall, which also generates alerts on the vulnerability. However, Cloud Firewall does not block the attacks that exploit the vulnerability.
        -   **Partially Prevented**: The vulnerability prevention feature is enabled on some of your Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances.
    -   **Details**: Click **Details** to open the **Vulnerability and Protection Details** page. On this page, you can view the details of the vulnerability, such as the name, CVE ID, risk level, and affected assets.
4.  On the Vulnerability Prevention page, search for the vulnerabilities that are in the **Alert Only** state. Then, click **Enable Prevention** in the **Actions** column.

    After vulnerability prevention is enabled, Cloud Firewall automatically enables the firewalls on your vulnerable assets. Wait for 1 or 2 minutes until the protection status of vulnerabilities is updated.

    **Note:** After vulnerability prevention is enabled, existing access control policies take effect on the assets on which firewalls are newly enabled. Make sure that traffic to the external ports of these assets is allowed. To allow the traffic, log on to the [Cloud Firewall console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=cfwnext), navigate to the Access Control page, and then click the **Inbound Policies** tab under the **Internet Firewall** tab.
