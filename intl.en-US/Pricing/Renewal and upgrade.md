# Renewal and upgrade {#concept_i1g_h3g_cfb .concept}

To ensure that the security protection services run properly, renew your subscription to the Cloud Firewall service before it expires.

## Renew the subscription to the Cloud Firewall service {#section_f3l_cjg_cfb .section}

Within the five days after the Cloud Firewall service subscription expires, Alibaba Cloud retains your configurations and data in Cloud Firewall. If you renew the subscription within this period, you can continue to use the current configurations and data.

If you do not renew the subscription within this period, all your configurations and data in Cloud Firewall are released. If you want to continue using the Cloud Firewall service, you need to subscribe to it again. For more information, see [Subscription](intl.en-US/Pricing/Subscription.md#section_gbn_fbc_zdb).
