# Upgrade Cloud Firewall and change configurations

If the current Cloud Firewall configurations do not meet your business requirements, you can upgrade the Cloud Firewall edition to enable the expert service feature and increase the numbers of protected public IP addresses and virtual private clouds \(VPCs\), the protected Internet traffic bandwidth, and the log storage capacity.

You can perform the following operations:

-   Upgrade Cloud Firewall to a higher edition.

    **Note:** You cannot downgrade Cloud Firewall. For example, if your Cloud Firewall runs the Ultimate edition, you cannot downgrade it to the Premium or Enterprise edition.

-   Change the configurations of each billable item. For example, you can change the configurations of Protected Public IP Addresses, Protected Internet Traffic, Protected VPCs, and Log Storage.

    **Note:** You can change the protected Internet traffic bandwidth only once each day. For more information, see [Upgrade the bandwidth configuration](#section_6yp_e00_pqy).

-   Enable the expert service feature.

    **Note:** If you have enabled the expert service feature, you can disable this feature when you upgrade Cloud Firewall.
