## What do I do after the 7-day free trial?

After the 7-day free trial, Cloud Firewall is restored to Basic Edition. Cloud Firewall Basic Edition checks the configurations of security groups, protects your assets against vulnerabilities, and supports the evaluation and consultation of classified protection compliance. If you want to use other features such as access control and intrusion prevention after the 7-day free trial, you must upgrade Cloud Firewall to a paid edition.
