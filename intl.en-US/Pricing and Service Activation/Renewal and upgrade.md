# Renewal and upgrade

Before your subscription to Cloud Firewall expires, renew it to ensure that the security protection services run properly. If the current Cloud Firewall configurations do not meet your business requirements, you can upgrade the edition or specifications of Cloud Firewall.

## Renew the subscription

Within the five days after the subscription expires, Alibaba Cloud retains your configurations and data on Cloud Firewall. If you renew the subscription within this period, you can continue to use your configurations and data.

**Note:** If you do not renew the subscription within this period, all your configurations and data on Cloud Firewall are released. In this case, if you want to continue using Cloud Firewall, you must subscribe to it again. For more information, see [Purchase Cloud Firewall](/intl.en-US/Pricing and Service Activation/Purchase a Cloud Firewall edition.md).

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Firewall console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=cfwnext).

2.  On the **Overview** page, click **Renew** in the upper-right corner.

3.  On the Renew page, select a value for **Duration**.

4.  Read and select **Cloud Firewall Terms of Service** and click **Buy Now**.

    After the renewal is completed, you can view the remaining validity days in the upper-right corner of the Overview page in the Cloud Firewall console.


## Enable the auto-renewal feature

After you enable auto-renewal, the system automatically deducts fees from your account and renews the subscription nine days before Cloud Firewall expires. Auto-renewal prevents service suspension in case you do not renew your service in time.

4.  In the Enable Auto Renewal dialog box, select a value from the Unified Auto Renewal Cycle drop-down list.

    After the auto-renewal configuration is completed, the number of remaining validity days is updated. You can view the remaining validity days in the upper-right corner of the Overview page.


## Upgrade the Cloud Firewall edition

If the current Cloud Firewall configurations do not meet your business requirements, you can upgrade the Cloud Firewall edition to increase the number of protected public IP addresses and VPCs, the protected Internet traffic bandwidth, and the log storage capacity, and to obtain the expert service. You can temporarily increase the protected Internet traffic bandwidth. You can also upgrade the Cloud Firewall edition on a daily basis. For information about the differences between Cloud Firewall editions, see [Editions and regions](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Editions and regions.md).

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Firewall console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=cfwnext).

    After the payment is completed, the new edition of Cloud Firewall takes effect immediately. You can view the information about the new edition in the upper-right corner of the Overview page in the Cloud Firewall console.
