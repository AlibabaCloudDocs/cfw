# Enable firewalls

After you purchase Cloud Firewall, the Internet and VPC firewalls are disabled by default. You can enable or disable firewalls for your assets on the Firewall Settings page of the Cloud Firewall console. When you enable a firewall, it takes effect immediately, and you do not need to perform complex configurations.

## Limits

Cloud Firewall Enterprise Edition and Ultimate Edition support virtual private cloud \(VPC\) firewalls. The free trial edition and the Premium Edition do not support VPC firewalls. For more information, see [Editions and regions](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Editions and regions.md).

For more information about the limits that you must bear in mind when you enable VPC firewalls, see [VPC firewall limits](/intl.en-US/Firewall Settings/VPC Firewall/VPC firewall limits.md).

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Firewall console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=cfwnext).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Firewall Settings** \> **Firewall Settings**.

3.  On the Firewall Settings page, enable firewalls.

    **Note:** Only Cloud Firewall Enterprise Edition and Ultimate Edition support VPC firewalls. If you use the free trial edition or the Premium Edition, the VPC Firewall tab does not appear on the Firewall Settings page.

    You can enable the **Internet firewall** or **VPC firewalls**.

    -   To enable the **Internet firewall**, perform the following steps:

        On the Internet Firewall tab, find the asset that you want to protect, and click **Enable Firewall** in the **Actions** column. If you want to enable or disable the Internet firewall for multiple assets at a time, select the assets. In the lower-left corner of the page, click **Enable Firewall** or **Disable Firewall**.

    -   To enable **VPC firewalls**, perform the following steps:

        On the VPC Firewall tab, find the asset that you want to protect, and click **Enable Firewall** in the **Actions** column. If you want to enable or disable VPC firewalls for multiple assets at a time, select the assets. In the lower-left corner of the page, click **Enable Firewall** or **Disable Firewall**.

    You can specify filter conditions to search for specific assets and check whether firewalls are enabled for the assets. The filter conditions include **Asset Type**, **Region**, **Protection Status**, and **Account**.
